# Edge AI Food Recognition

A lightweight, privacy-first image classification system for **real-time food item recognition** in smart kitchens. Built using **TensorFlow 2.x** and **TensorFlow Lite**, this project supports dietary tracking and kitchen automation on **edge devices**—with no cloud or internet dependency.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ MobileNetV2 backbone for ultra-efficient inference
- 🔄 Data augmentation pipeline for better generalization
- 🎯 Top-1 and Top-3 class prediction support
- 📦 Easy TensorFlow Lite export for edge deployment
- 🔐 Privacy-by-design: all computation runs locally

## 🛠️ Installation
